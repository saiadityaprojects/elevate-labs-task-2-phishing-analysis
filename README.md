The goal of this project was to analyze a simulated phishing email, identify its key characteristics, and report on the findings. This task was designed to develop practical skills in email threat detection and analysis.

Methodology
The analysis was conducted using a systematic approach:

A sample phishing email impersonating a well-known company was used for the analysis.

The sender's details and email headers were examined for signs of spoofing.

The email's content was inspected for social engineering tactics, such as urgent language, generic greetings, and grammar errors.

Links within the email were carefully checked for mismatches between the display text and the actual destination URL.
